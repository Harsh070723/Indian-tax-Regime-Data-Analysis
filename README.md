Key Highlights:

Comparative analysis of taxpayers opting for the Old vs New tax regime.

Average tax paid segmented by occupation and state-wise income distribution.

Monthly trends in return filings categorized by status (Filed, Pending, Processed).

Correlation between taxable income and tax paid visualized through a scatter plot.

Overview of deductions claimed under sections 80C, 80D, and 80G.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) including total tax paid, average gross income, and refund metrics.

The dashboard emphasizes clarity, interactivity, and usability, making it an ideal analytical tool for financial professionals, tax analysts, and policymakers. It also demonstrates proficiency in data modeling, DAX measures, and advanced Power BI visualization techniques.
